#+TITLE: Gazelle Notes

* Gazelle

Let's see how to use [[https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle][gazelle]].

1. Clone a golang project which is not using bazel.
2. Create a 'WORKSPACE' file (in project root) based on https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle#id2
3. Create a =BUILD= file (in project root) with this content :

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   load("@bazel_gazelle//:def.bzl", "gazelle")

   # gazelle:prefix github.com/example/project
   gazelle(name = "gazelle")
   #+END_EXAMPLE

4. Run ~bazel run //:gazelle~

What happened so far :

1. =WORKSPACE= file is used to specify a project and external bazel dependencies (like gazelle).
2. =BUILD= files defines a ~gazelle~ target which is used to invoke gazelle binary.
3. In turn gazelle binary generates our ~BUILD~ files in other project directories.

I am not sure how it decides the build targets in those generated =BUILD= files, but most likely
non-main package are treated as libs, and main packages as bins.

But we are not done yet. If you follow the referenced tutorial, you'll see that we have not solved
the issue of external go dependencies yet. Reason being =gazelle= has only used current project structure
and files to auto-generated =BUILD= files. But it doesn't know yet on where to find the external deps
(like github ones).

But one nice thing with =go= is that it generates a =go.mod= files, which lists down these external deps.
So gazelle can just use that to create appropriate targets for these external deps.

Add this new target in top-level =BUILD= file :

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
gazelle(
    name = "gazelle-update-repos",
    args = [
        "-from_file=go.mod",
        "-to_macro=deps.bzl%go_dependencies",
        "-prune",
        "-build_file_proto_mode=disable_global",
    ],
    command = "update-repos",
)
#+END_EXAMPLE

And run ~bazel run //:gazelle-update-repos~

This will generate a file named ~deps.bzl~ which will have targets for external go repos.
And it'll also update our =WORKSPACE= file to import this ~deps.bzl~ file, sweet.
